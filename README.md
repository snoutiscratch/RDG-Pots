#  RDG-Pots
Potion calculator for the Roblox Game [Randomly Generated Droids](https://www.roblox.com/games/5561268850/Randomly-Generated-Droids). It's completely redundant as the game itself has a potion calculater that's far more convenient than this one as the official calculator can read the player's inventory.

Because of the inbuilt calculator, this project was killed before a working prototype was made.
